InitDB contains the psd's (and menubar.png) used to generate piroplasmadb:

new_piro was generated from new_micro
from new_piro, backgroundtop_s (swoosh) and background_s were generated

the menubar in this file (new_ ) is darker than the menubar.png used by all sites under assets/images
I generated menubar7.png by ligtheining menubar.png, and it matched the background_s in piro 
I copied his new menubar under Piroplasma directory and a new css piro_menubar was added in css/PiroplasmaDB.css/

missing images were copied from other sites such as :
- trheader.png and trsubhead.png used in query grid and results page
- some of the bubble headers

For sidebar  menu_lft.psd was used.
