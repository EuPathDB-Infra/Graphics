This is a contract between you and Berthold. This is not a contract for sale of font software, but a license to use font software subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Please read the terms carefully. You, on behalf of your employer or personally, agree as follows:<br><br>

THIS IS A NON-REFUNDABLE PRODUCT<br><br>

Font Software. The font software you selected to license (the &quot;Font Software&quot;), is the property of Berthold. The term &quot;Font Software&quot; includes any related documentation, updates and permitted copies of the Font Software licensed to you by Berthold. As used in this Agreement, the term &quot;Berthold&quot; means collectively Berthold, its successors and assigns, its affiliated companies, its authorized distributors and resellers, and any third party which has licensed to Berthold any or all of the intellectual property rights associated with the Font Software.<br><br>

Limited License. Upon payment of the nonrefundable license fee, Berthold grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited right to use the Font Software for personal or internal business use by you on the permitted number of Licensed Computers at a single, physical location designated by you (the &quot;Licensed Location&quot;). The term &quot;use&quot; means to install and access the Font Software, and give commands (by keyboard or otherwise) followed by the Font Software.<br><br>

The permitted number of Licensed Computers is 5 unless you have obtained a license for additional Licensed Computers (available in increments of 5). For each 5 Licensed Computers, you may also download the Font Software to the memory (hard disk or RAM) of 1 output device connected to 1  Licensed Computer for the purpose of having the Font Software remain resident in the output device.<br><br>

However, if you license the Berthold Exklusiv Collection or the Adobe Berthold Exklusiv Collection, the permitted number of Licensed Computers is 20 unless you have obtained a license for additional Licensed Computers (available in increments of 10). For each 20 Licensed Computers, you may download the Font Software to the memory (hard disk or RAM) of 2 output devices connected to 2  Licensed Computers for the purpose of having the Font Software remain resident in the output devices.<br><br>

Portable computers may be included within the number of permitted Licensed Computers provided that such portable computers are primarily used at the Licensed Location.<br><br>

You may install the Font Software on a file server for use on a local area network located at the Licensed Location, provided that use of the Font Software is limited to those computers that are the Licensed Computers. For the avoidance of doubt, each computer that will access the Font Software on the network must be a Licensed Computer located at the Licensed Location. You may not install the Font Software on a file server that can be accessed via the Internet or other external network system by computers and printers not located at the Licensed Location.<br><br>

Embedding Restrictions. Embedding of the Font Software is prohibited except as expressly provided in this section.<br><br>

You may embed the Font Software into electronic documents for use on computers that are NOT Licensed Computers, subject to the following restrictions: (a) the electronic documents are distributed in a secure format that allows only printing and viewing, and prohibits editing, selecting, enhancing or modifying the text; and (b) the electronic documents are for personal or internal business use. If you are unable to limit access to the document to &quot;view and print&quot; only, then the electronic document may not be used on computers that are NOT Licensed Computers.<br><br>

You may embed the Font Software into electronic documents for use on computers that are Licensed Computers provided that the electronic documents are for personal or internal business use.<br><br>

Without the purchase of an additional license, you may NOT otherwise embed the Font Software. For example and without limitation: (i) You may NOT embed the Font Software into your hardware, software or other products, such as, application programs, electronic games, e-books, kiosks, printers, etc.; (ii) You may NOT embed the Font Software into your web pages; and (iii) You may NOT embed the Font Software into electronic documents that permit editing, selecting, enhancing or other modifying of the text.<br><br>

All permitted copies you make must contain the exact copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices that appear on and/or in the Font Software.<br><br>

Termination. The license rights granted under this Agreement will immediately and automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must destroy all copies of the Font Software. The balance of the Agreement shall survive any such termination of license rights.<br><br>

Limited Warranty.

Berthold will correct substantial malfunctions occurring during this warranty period provided that such malfunctions are reproducible, your product is properly registered, and you give immediate notice and sufficient detail of such malfunctions to Berthold. Such corrections generally will be incorporated into new revisions of the Font Software, or until the release of such new revisions into temporary versions, at Berthold’s discretion. The correction may also be achieved by delivery of new versions of the Font Software in which case the warranty does not cover such additional functionality and performance. Berthold will have no responsibility in the event you fail to provide proof you licensed the Font Software from an authorized Berthold source.<br><br>
